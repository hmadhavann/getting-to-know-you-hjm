<h3 style="background-color: burlywood;"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>My name is Hima Madhavan and I am a freshman at Lewis University. I am majoring in computer science, though I have been thinking about adding a minor.
     My parents were both born in India, and came to America at at different times in their lives.
     I was born in Illinois, and have been in Illinois for my entire life.
     At home I have a pet dog named Sebastian. I am looking forward to what these next four years will bring me! 
    Quite honestly, I was very nervous about choosing my major, especially given how everyone always talked about how difficult it is.
     Also because I never really knew what computer science was, but slowly I am learning more. &#128512</p>

<h2 style="background-color: coral;"><i>My Favorite Hobbies</i></h2>
<p> My favoirte hobby would have to be either reading, journaling or simply watching tv. I don't really have time to read or journal, given my current schedule,
     but when I have free time, I really enjoy picking up a book. My favorite genres include romance and fantasy, but I will practically read anything. 
     Journaling is very therapuetic for me, and it is a fun way for me to get my thoughts downn on paper.
      I journal digitally and on paper, it all depends on my mood. 
     My last 'hobby' is watching tv. This is just a mindless activity I like to do when I relax.
      I do this more often than reading and journaling during the school year,
      if I am being honest. I watch Netflix and Youtube primarily, and I pretty much watch anything. 
      Currently, I am on a binge of old tv shows that I used to watch when I was younger. &#128517</p>
